# PyBer Analysis

Creating multiple visualizations graphs to help understand and study datasets, knowing how and when to use each graph varies on different datatypes.

## Overview of the analysis:

From this challenge we improt the csv file and by dividing each columns into different datasets and combined them and replaced the index to: Urban, Rural, Suburban. So we can turn it into plots for better understanding the fares between these city types.


## Results:
From the graph generated(attached below) from the dataset we can easily tell that:

- Rural areas have least fares and reaches to it's peak on April
- Urban areas are most expensive fares in those 3 city types and it's peaking from March to April.
- There is a larger use of ridesharing in urban cities
- There are more drivers in urban cities than rural cities.
- Overall, ridersharing services significantly differs in rural, suruban, and urban cities given the number of rides, drivers, and fares. Data supports that there is higher usage of PyBer ridesharing services in urban cities.


## Summary
DataFrame provides an overview comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: rural, surburban, and urban cities. The summary demonstrates that there is a larger demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities.
